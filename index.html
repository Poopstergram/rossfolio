                <h1>Ross Dyson</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">SF today, space tomorrow</p>
                <p>Like his father, Ross likes to get his hands dirty.</p>

                <p>A small-town nerdy kid, Ross naturally fell in love with the internet. He was often found in front of the family PC getting lost in virtual worlds, reading Japanese manga, and torrent'ing everything that should have been out of reach.</p>

                <p>During his adventures in cyberspace, Ross built an online forum for a video game to hang out with other players and learn their hacks (<i>unfair advantages</i>). As a reward for graduating/surviving highschool he sold the website for a ticket to Japan, returning 2 years later in 2008 with fluent Japanese and dreams of a web-based future.</p>

                <p>Ross attended the Australian National University to study software engineering like a normal nerd, but now spent his summers and any time free-time travelling more or hustling to afford it.</p>

                <p>Graduating in 2012 and heavily in debt, he instictively graviated to the $$$ of contact front-end development for startups and corporations in Sydney.</p>

                <p>In 2015 he attended [and won] his first hackathon, gave up the easy IT engineer life and beaches of Sydney, and moved to SF to make something that mattered.</p>
